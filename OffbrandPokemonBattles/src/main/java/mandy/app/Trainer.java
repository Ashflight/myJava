    // for team management, maybe also item management if I add items. stuff like switching and tracking fainting.
    // also for obvious i don't want to write down every pokemon in existence reasons there shall be a finite number of team options
    // prioritising the rival trio/Arven, Nemona, and Penny, then gen 9 DLC main characters/Carmine and Kieran.
    // then gen 9 gym leaders, BB elite 4, regular elite 4 + Geeta, team star leaders, and finally maybe the academy faculty.
    // should be a random option too ofc
    // basically just pick one out of a bunch of preset copypastas
    // i severely underestimated how complicated this would get
